BOOSTING - HOW SHOULD IT WORK?

1 - Player presses the boost key (_input, player_generic.gd). is_boosting = true

2 - Boost counter starts increasing (_input, player_generic.gd). if is_boosting: boosting_counter ++

3 - For boost counter being 1, set up the boost stuff (player_<name>.gd).

4 - Reset boost counter to zero when the boost key is no longer pressed (player_<name>.gd). boosting_counter = 0 ; is_boosting = false
