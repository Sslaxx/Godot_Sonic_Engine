TODO as of 19-Dec-2018:

Both implement and (if necessary) document.

* Jump (via way in design docs or more like Sonic Outbreak?)
* Loop-the-loop
* Boilerplate/generic badnik code
* Death and game over (maybe time over?)
* Level start
* End of level
* Checkpoints
* Collectibles
* Boilerplate for powerups
