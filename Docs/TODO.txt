TODO as of 31-Jan-2019:

Both implement and (if necessary) document.

* Jump (via way in design docs or more like Sonic Outbreak?) - MOSTLY DONE. Refined control still required.
* Loop-the-loop
* Boilerplate/generic badnik code
* Death and game over (maybe time over?)
* Level start
* End of level
* Boilerplate for powerups
* Angling player characters to slopes - MOSTLY DONE. Sanity checking and method need to be refined.
