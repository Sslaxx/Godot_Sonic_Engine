Sonic collision shape (CapsuleShape2D)
radius = 10
height = 20

if (abs (avgGPoint.y-position.y) < 21): - this *appears* to be "collison shape height + 1"?

position = Vector2 (avgGPoint.x + 20 * sin (rotation), avgGPoint.y - 20 * cos (rotation)) - avgGPoint.x might be "collision shape radius * 2"?

LeftCast.get_collision_point ().x + cos (rotation) * 8, - this appears to be unconnected to the collision shape values.

Highest degree of confidence with "21", as it seems to be only y-component related.
